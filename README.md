# US-House-Price-Data-Science-Project

US Home Prices Analysis
Introduction
This project aims to analyze and understand the key factors influencing US home prices over the last 20 years. By collecting and examining various economic and demographic indicators, we seek to uncover insights that can provide valuable information for stakeholders in the real estate market.

Step-by-Step Plan
Define the Problem: Understand how different factors such as GDP, unemployment rate, interest rates, and population dynamics affect home prices in the US.

Data Collection: Gather data from reliable sources such as Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), government agencies, and real estate platforms.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing or normalizing where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the data using various visualizations to understand trends, correlations, and distributions.

Feature Engineering: Create new features that may have an impact on home prices, such as lagged variables or rolling averages.

Model Building: Construct predictive models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, or Neural Networks to analyze the relationship between factors and home prices.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like RÂ², RMSE, and MAE to understand their predictive performance.

Interpretation: Interpret the model results to identify the most significant factors influencing home prices and provide actionable insights.

Reporting: Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the methodology, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders.

Deployment (Optional): Deploy the model as a web application or API for interactive use.

Adding Uniqueness to Your Project
Interactive Visualizations: Use tools like Plotly or Bokeh to create interactive plots.
Geospatial Analysis: Incorporate geographical data for a spatial analysis of home prices.
Time Series Analysis: Apply time series models like ARIMA or Prophet for forecasting.
Web App: Deploy your model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for interactive exploration.
Conclusion
By following this plan and incorporating unique elements into your project, you can create a comprehensive data science project that provides valuable insights into US home prices and their influencing factors.
